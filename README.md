This is a small TG library bot created by me. It is very short and light, and some things were done in a simplified form, 
but I had an idea to test the telegram api for the file transfer, and also to create a simple file selection interface. Subsequently, this project can be improved to a more acceptable level

Files were taken from the site https://www.tofugu.com/
